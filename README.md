## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my repository!

I'm **Mahdi Mohammadi**, a Junior AI Engineer at Golrang System and an M.Sc. student in **Industrial Engineering â€“ Systems Modeling and Data Analysis** at [Tehran Polytechnic](https://aut.ac.ir/en). I also hold a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

ðŸ”¬ I'm passionate about **data science, machine learning**, and building intelligent systems. Iâ€™ve worked on real-world projects involving:
- **LLM-based document intelligence**
- **Data-driven quality metrics for national standards**

ðŸ›  I work mainly with **Python**, but also have experience with **C++**, **R**, **Julia** and tools like:
- **PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn**
- **Docker, Django, FastAPI**
- **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Qdrant**

ðŸ“š I'm always learning â€” especially in areas like **NLP**, **optimization**, and **AI system design** â€” and I enjoy applying what I learn to practical challenges.

Feel free to explore my projects, connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mo-mahdi1379), or reach out. Let's build something meaningful together!
